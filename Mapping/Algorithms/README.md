# Mapping Algorithms

## Bellman-Ford
Does the same thing as Dikjtra, but it can handle negative weigths. It can detect nagative cycles.  

## Dikjtra
Used to find smallest path from one node to any other node with non-negative weigth on vertices.  
An example of its usage could be google maps and finding shortest route

## Ford-Faherson
Something

## Kruskal 
Used to find minimun spanning tree. The shortest route that goes througth all the nodes.  
An example of this would be in a delivery service that has to go to all houses

## Prim
Used to find minimun spanning tree, just like Kruskal.

## Warshall
Something
