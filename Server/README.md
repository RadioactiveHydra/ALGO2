For the web interface, add html files inside of views/ and use printHTMLFile(filename). This will add beg.html and end.html to all the pages. Add any styling or anything you want to appear at the top inside of beg.html and add scripts (to help load timec) and footers to end.html
Changing an HTML file doesn't mean you have to restart the server

You are welcome to edit this README, I just wrote really fast before I had to go on a trip
